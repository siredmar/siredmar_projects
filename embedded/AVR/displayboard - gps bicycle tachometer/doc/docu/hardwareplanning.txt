1. What Processor do we need? 
Easy to use Atmel Atmega 8Bit CPU
-> 8 Bit for the application sufficent
-> Low Power 3.3V
=> Atmega32L

2. What GPS Receiver do we need?
Research of available GPS Receivers
-> found Module with RS232 and 3.3V TTL Levels for TXD and RXD 
-> no extra levelshifting necessary
=> NL-552ETTL

-> for UART communication it's adviced to use a oscillator with a low failure rate
-> The Atmega32L supports @3.3V max 8.0MHz (see slide comparison)
=> 7.3728 MHz oscillator

3. What display do we need?
Research of cheap graphical displays
-> found EA-DOG family with 3.3V power supply
-> easy to use via SPI

4. What Storage Card do we need?
-> SD-Card with 3.3V supply fits
-> easy to use via SPI
